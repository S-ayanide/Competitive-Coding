## Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

## A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

# _Example 1:_
```
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

# _Example 2:_
```
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```
# Constraints:
## The given address is a valid IPv4 address.
